          Unschooling is an informal learning that advocates learner-chosen
          activities as a primary means or learning. Unschoolers learn through
          their natural life experiences.

            The term "unschooling" probably derives from Ivan Illich's term
            "deschooling", and was popularized through John Holt's newsletter
            Growing Without Schooling (GWS). Holt is also widely regarded as the
            father of unschooling. In an early essay, Holt contrasted the two
            terms:<br /><br /><q
              >GWS will say 'unschooling' when we mean taking children out of
              school, and 'deschooling' when we mean changing the laws to make
              schools non-compulsory...</q
            ><br /><br />At this point the term was equivalent with "home
            schooling" (itself a neologism). Subsequently, home schoolers began
            to differentiate between various educational philosophies within
            home schooling. The term "unschooling" became used as a contrast to
            versions of home schooling that were perceived as politically and
            pedagogically "school-like," using textbooks and exercises at home,
            the same way they would be used at school. In 2003, in Holt's book
            Teach Your Own (originally published in 1981), Pat Farenga,
            co-author of the new edition, provided a definition:<br /><br /><q
              >When pressed, I define unschooling as allowing children as much
              freedom to learn in the world as their parents can comfortably
              bear.</q
            ><br /><br />In the same passage Holt stated that he was not
            entirely comfortable with this term, and that he would have
            preferred the term "living". Holt's use of the term emphasizes
            learning as a natural process, integrated into the spaces and
            activities of everyday life, and not benefiting from adult
            manipulation. It follows closely on the themes of educational
            philosophies proposed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jiddu Krishnamurti,
            Paul Goodman, and A.S. Neill. Other unschooling practitioners
            defines unschooling as:<br /><br />
            <strong>Freechild Project</strong>
            <q
              >the process of learning through life, without formalized or
              institutionalized classrooms or schoolwork.</q
            ><br /><br />
            <strong>Sandra Dodd</strong>
            <q
              >unschooling is a non-coercive, cooperative practice, and seeks to
              promote those values in all areas of life.</q
            ><br /><br />
            <strong>Peter Gray</strong> suggested the term
            <q>self-directed education</q><br /><br />
            Even though unschooling is often seen as a subset of homeschooling
            and homeschooling has been the subject of broad public debate,
            unschooling in particular has received relatively little media
            attention and has only become increasingly popular in recent years.
            Unschooling is also sometimes considered the freest form of
            homeschooling.

            Unschoolers question schools for lessening the parent/child bond and
            reducing family time and creating atmospheres of fear, or
            atmospheres that are not conducive for learning and may not even
            correspond with later success. Some unschoolers criticize that in
            schools, children are taught a set of facts and skills that they
            might not need in the future anymore, while with unschooling, they
            learn how to learn, which is far more sustainable for their life.
            Also, some say that in school, children are only taught how to
            follow instructions, which means that they face problems with doing
            tasks they have not done before. Another argument is that the
            structure of school is not suitable for people who want to make
            their own decisions about what, when, how and with whom they learn
            because many things are predetermined there, while you are more free
            in these decisions when unschooled.<br /><br />
            Often those in school have a community consisting mainly of a peer
            group, of which the parent has little influence and even knowledge.
            Unschoolers may have time to share a role in their greater
            community, therefore relating more to older and younger individuals
            and finding their place within more diverse groups of people.
            Parents of school children also have little say regarding who their
            instructors and teachers are, whereas parents of unschoolers may be
            more involved in the selection of the coaches or mentors their
            children work with and with whom they build lasting and ongoing
            relationships. <br />
            <br />
            According to unschooling pioneer John Holt, child-led learning is
            more efficient and respectful of children's time, takes advantage of
            their interests, and allows deeper exploration of subjects than what
            is possible in conventional education.<br /><br />
            <q
              >The anxiety children feel at constantly being tested, their fear
              of failure, punishment, and disgrace, severely reduces their
              ability both to perceive and to remember, and drives them away
              from the material being studied into strategies for fooling
              teachers into thinking they know what they really don't know.</q
            ><br /><br />
            Others point out that some schools can be non-coercive and
            cooperative, in a manner consistent with the philosophies behind
            unschooling. Sudbury model schools are non-coercive,
            non-indoctrinative, cooperative, democratically run partnerships
            between children and adults, including full parents' partnership,
            where learning is individualized and child-led, and complements home
            education.<br /><br />
            Concerns about socialization can also be a factor in the decision to
            unschool. Some unschoolers believe that conditions in conventional
            schools, such as age segregation, the ratio of children to adults,
            or the amount of time spent sitting and obeying orders of one
            authority figure, are not conducive to proper education.<br /><br />Unschooling
            is claimed to broaden the diversity of people or places an
            unschooler may be exposed to. Unschoolers may be more mature than
            their schooled peers on average, and some believe this is a result
            of the wide range of people they have the opportunity to interact
            with. Opportunities for unschoolers to meet and interact with other
            unschoolers has increased in recent years, allowing unschoolers to
            have interactions with other children with similar experiences.

          <p>
            A fundamental premise of unschooling is that learning is a natural
            process constantly taking place and that curiosity is innate and
            children want to learn. From this, an argument can be made that
            institutionalizing children in a so-called "one size fits all" or
            "factory model" school is an inefficient use of the children's time
            and potential, because it requires each child to learn specific
            subject matter in a particular manner, at a particular pace, and at
            a specific time regardless of that individual's present or future
            needs, interests, goals, or any pre-existing knowledge they might
            have about the topic.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning styles</li>
            <p>
              Unschoolers note that psychologists have documented many
              differences between children in the way they learn, and assert
              that unschooling is better equipped to adapt to these
              differences.<br /><br />People vary in their "learning styles",
              that is, the preference in how they acquire new information.
              However, research has demonstrated that this preference is not
              related to increased learning or improved performance. Students
              have different learning needs. In a traditional school setting,
              teachers seldom evaluate an individual student differently from
              other students, and while teachers often use different methods,
              this is sometimes haphazard and not always with regard to an
              individual student.
            </p>
            <li>Developmental differences</li>
            <p>
              Developmental psychologists note that just as children reach
              growth milestones at different ages from each other, children are
              also prepared to learn different things at different ages. Just as
              some children learn to walk during a normal range of eight to
              fifteen months, and begin to talk across an even larger range,
              unschoolers assert that they are also ready and able to read, for
              example, at different ages, girls usually earlier than boys.
              <br /><br />In fact, experts have discovered that natural learning
              produces far greater changes in behavior than do traditional
              learning methods, though not necessarily an increase in the amount
              of information learned. Traditional education requires all
              children to begin reading at the same time and do multiplication
              at the same time; unschoolers believe that some children cannot
              help but be bored because this was something that they had been
              ready to learn earlier, and even worse, some children cannot help
              but fail, because they are not yet ready for this new information
              being taught.
            </p>
            <li>Essential body of knowledge</li>
            <p>
              Unschoolers sometimes state that learning any specific subject is
              less important than learning how to learn. They assert, in the
              words of Holt:<br /><br /><q
                >Since we can't know what knowledge will be most needed in the
                future, it is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead,
                we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and
                learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever must be
                learned.</q
              ><br /><br />It is asserted that this ability to learn on their
              own makes it more likely that later, when these children are
              adults, they can continue to learn what they need to know to meet
              newly emerging needs, interests, and goals; and that they can
              return to any subject that they feel was not sufficiently covered
              or learn a completely new subject.<br /><br />Many unschoolers
              disagree that there is a particular body of knowledge that every
              person, regardless of the life they lead, needs to possess.
              Unschoolers argue that, in the words of John Holt, <br /> <br/><q
                >If children are given access to enough of the world, they will
                see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves
                and to others, and they will make for themselves a better path
                into that world than anyone else could make for them.</q
              >
            </p>
            <li>The role of parents</li>
            <p>
              Parents of unschoolers provide resources, support, guidance,
              information, and advice to facilitate experiences that aid their
              children in accessing, navigating, and making sense of the world.
              Common parental activities include sharing interesting books,
              articles, and activities with their children, helping them find
              knowledgeable people to explore an interest with (anyone from
              physics professors to automotive mechanics), and helping them set
              goals and figure out what they need to do to meet their goals.<br /><br />
              Unschooling's interest-based nature does not mean that it is a
              "hands off" approach to education. Parents tend to involve
              themselves, especially with younger children.
              <em> Older children, unless new to unschooling, often need less help
                finding resources and making and carrying out plans.</em
              >
            </p>
            <li>Paradigm shift</li>
            <p>
              Unschooling opposes many aspects of what the dominant culture
              insists are true, and it may be impossible to fully understand the
              unschooling philosophy of education without both active
              participation and a major paradigm shift. The cognitive dissonance
              that frequently accompanies this paradigm shift is uncomfortable.
              New unschoolers are advised that they should not expect to
              understand the unschooling philosophy at first. Not only are there
              many commonplace assumptions about education, there are many
              unspoken and unwritten expectations. One step towards overcoming
              the necessary paradigm shift is accepting that, <br /><q
                >what we do is nowhere near as important as why we do it.</q
              ><br /><br />While opponents of the concept of unschooling
              criticize the fact that it cannot be ensured that children receive
              a neutral, comprehensive education and fear that children may be
              at the mercy of bad parents, resulting in parallel societies, many
              advocates of unschooling doubt that or at least question whether
              such an education exists universally objectively seen and note
              that in school, people do not learn a lot of what they are
              guaranteed to need for their life either and that when unschooled,
              more efficient and independent learning guided by their own
              interests increases the probability that children will be well
              equipped for their future life because they learned how to learn
              and already roughly know what they are interested in and some
              things about these areas.<br /><br />They also find that children
              can be at least just as much at the mercy of one or more bad
              teachers and classmates in school and consider it exceedingly
              unrealistic that parents would completely isolate their children
              from external social influences or even criticize school as an
              institution in which children are fobbed off from the outside
              world and therefore see school itself as a parallel society. From
              then on, it is only a subjective decision as to where, when, how
              and with whom education should take place, which those to be
              educated should answer themselves, or, if necessary, with people
              directly involved in their education, like their parents or other
              people who educate them.

            Unschooling is a form of homeschooling, which is the education of
            children at home or other places rather than in a school. It
            involves teaching children based on their interests rather than a
            set curriculum.<br /><br />Unschooling contrasts with other forms of
            homeschooling in that the student's education is not directed by a
            teacher and curriculum. Unschooling is a real-world implementation
            of "The Open Classroom" methods promoted in the late 1960s and early
            1970s, without the school, classrooms or grades. Parents who
            unschool their children act as facilitators, providing a range of
            resources, helping their children access, navigate, and make sense
            of the world, and aiding them in making and implementing goals and
            plans for both the distant and immediate future. Unschooling expands
            from children's natural curiosity as an extension of their
            interests, concerns, needs, goals, and plans.<br /><br />Unschooling
            differs from discovery learning, minimally invasive education,
            purpose-guided education, academic advising, phenomenon-based
            learning and thematic learning

            There are many different branches, possibilities, and approaches of
            designing and practicing unschooling, some of the most popular
            include the following:<br /><br /><strong>Worldschooling</strong>,
            in which families travel around the world and learn through
            experiencing other places, people, cultures, and activities typical
            for these locations.<br /><br /><strong
              >Project-based unschooling</strong
            >, which holds that students acquire a deeper knowledge through
            active exploration of real-world challenges, problems and projects
            that they can do in their own way and time.<br /><br /><strong
              >Gameschooling</strong
            >, in which various games like board and card games are important to
            homeschool learning method, and educational philosophy. In addition
            to developing skills in math, language, history, board games are
            also used to develop social skills such as interpersonal
            communication, negotiation, persuasion, diplomacy, and moral
            character such as good sportsmanship.
